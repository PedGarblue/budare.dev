Personal website and Porfolio built with Vue.js and TailwindCSS

**NOTE**: This repo is not minded to be a template, just for my own use. Feel free to take whatever inspiration from it that you want, but this code was not written with the intention of being cloned and deployed. As such, I do not provide support or guidance for doing that.

# Roadmap

## Features and improvements
- [x] Add About me section
- [x] Rework Skills section

# Code changes / refactors
- [ ] move to a component the tooltip code in /src/components/CopyEmail.vue
- [ ] ~~make a composable the scroll section navigation in /src/views/PageHome.vue~~ removed the scroll by section navigation.
- [ ] **BIG** migrate all the canvas animations to WebGl, 2D rendering makes the page slow

# Bugs
- [ ] ~~apparently there are some issues with the scroll section navigation in mobile could not reproduce it in my device.~~ removed the scroll by section navigation.

# Notes

- Why not use a UI Library?
    because i'm bored enough to do it myself and i don't think should be necessary for the size of this project.
